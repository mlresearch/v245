    abstract = {Event extraction involves the identification and extraction of specific event-related information from a large corpus of textual data. In recent years, the introduction of pre-trained models has significantly enhanced the ability of these models to comprehend the semantics of sentences, leading to continuous advancements in event extraction methods. However, when it comes to long and complex sentences, these models have shown limited performance. This limitation can be attributed to the intricate structures of such sentences, which hinder the models' ability to grasp their semantic meaning. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel model that combines dependency analysis tools with the Longformer pre-trained model. By effectively analyzing the structures of complex sentences, our model aims to enhance the semantic understanding of these sentences. Experimental results using the ACE2005 dataset demonstrate the improved performance of our model in event extraction for complex sentences.}

    abstract = {Biomedical Relationship Extraction (BioRE) is an important task for electronic health record mining and biomedical knowledge base construction. Due to the complexity of biomedical information in the literature, it is difficult to realize the construction of large-scale datasets. Although previous models showed good results in a fully supervised environment, they did not generalize well to the low resource situation common in this field. We propose a biomedical relationship extraction model based on deep transfer learning and prompt learning. We use deep neural network for transfer learning, using large-scale biomedical field data set (BioREx) training model. The trained model was applied to low-resource datasets in biomedical field, which can make the model to learn more rich knowledge, so as to alleviate the problem of insufficient training data. In addition, we used a prompt learning method by appending a prompt sentence describing the desired relationship label to the beginning of the input sentence, which can reduce the gap between the pretrained language model (PLM) and downstream tasks. Experiments show that using deep transfer learning and prompt learning can effectively improve the prediction results. Experiments on three BioRE benchmark datasets DrugProt, DDI and BC5CDR, F1 values are significantly improved compared to previous models.}

    abstract = {The convolutional module-based speaker representation network has demonstrated outstanding performance in the speaker verification (SV) task and has now become one of the widely adopted network structures in this task field. There are some limitations to the convolution-based network structure, specifically with the fixed-size convolution kernel in the general convolution operation. This makes it difficult to capture long-range time-frequency and channel dependencies in speech features, limiting the network's ability to extract representations of the speaker. To overcome this issue, we have explored several alternative approaches. Firstly, we propose an enhanced selfcalibrating convolutional kernel that adaptively constructs long-range time-frequency and channel dependencies around each time-frequency position. This allows for the integration of richer information, significantly enhancing the network's capacity to learn representations. Secondly, we have made adjustments to the network structure to improve the extraction of speaker feature representations. We refer to this modified model as SpcNet. In this paper, our proposed SpcNet model has been experimented on the datasets VoxCeleb1 and VoxCeleb2. Comprehensive experiments show that the Equal Error Rate (EER) is significantly improved.}

    abstract = {Weakly-Supervised Learning (WSL) has been increasingly concerned in Whole-Slide Image (WSI) classification, meanwhile, an open question arises: could WSL-based models provide us with an accurate interpretation of their decisions? Although many research works have made exciting progress via building an Auxiliary Instance Branch (AIB) on a bag-level network, there are still two typical problems to be confronted with in training WSL-based AIB: i) an overwhelming influence of negative instances and ii) the inconsistent learning between bag-level network and AIB. To address them, this paper proposes collaborative learning with curriculum loss. This scheme, on one hand, provides a curriculum loss for optimizing AIB, to alleviate the first problem. Considering the knowledge reliability in WSL, this loss generalizes an original quality focal loss to WSL scenarios by curriculum instances. On the other hand, to overcome the second problem, this scheme trains a bag-level network under the supervision of AIB by a reversed curriculum loss, making both learn collaboratively. Comparative experiments prove that our scheme could often surpass existing ones in both accuracy and interpretability. Moreover, it is found that the knowledge reliability-inspired curriculum instance is a critical factor in bringing comprehensive improvements.}

    abstract = {Word Sense Disambiguation is a process to determine the best meaning of an ambiguous word according to its contextual semantic information. Many methods ofWord Sense Disambiguation cannot deal with polysemous words well because they only consider the meaning of the adjacent words before and after ambiguous words, and cannot consider the meaning of all words in the sentence globally. In order to solve the above problems, this paper proposes a word sense disambiguation method based on Multiple Sense Graph. This method applies the BERT model to generate word sense vectors, and globally considers the feature relationship between the ambiguous word and all words in the context. In addition, this method applies the PageRank algorithm to score the importance of each sense vector of the word, and the scoring results are sorted to obtain the best sense of the ambiguous word. The experimental results indicate that the proposed BERT-PageRank method improves the evaluation index compared with the other two semantic disambiguation methods. In summary, the proposed method improves the accuracy of word sense disambiguation to obtain the best word sense.}

Based on the keyword-reviewer bipartite graph, a graph neural network model is constructed. By utilizing graph neural networks, high-order relationships between reviews and keywords can be explored, enabling the discovery of reviews' implicit research interests and expanding their re-search interests to some extent. Additionally, incorporating keyword-keyword interaction graphs and review-review interaction graphs allows for information exchange operations in the two graphs separately, enhancing the representation of keywords and reviews. We conducted experiments on real thesis reviews and compared the proposed algorithm with other recommendation algorithms. The results show that the proposed algorithm achieves favorable results across various evaluation metrics, demonstrating the effectiveness of the algorithm presented in this paper.

    abstract = {Methods based on automatic computer-aided systems for lung cancer diagnosis have gained popu-larity in recent years. Lung parenchyma segmentation technology plays an important role in these methods. To reduce the gradient loss, improve the feature utilization, and alleviate the difficulty of fully mining the contextual information in lung parenchyma segmentation, this study proposes a network model for lung parenchyma segmentation based on a Multiscale fusion and Boundary Refinement UNet (MBR–UNet) model. First, along the encoding path, the features are efficiently extracted by a Residual–Residual block module. Next, along the decoding path, a multiscale at-tention–spatial pyramid pooling module fully integrates the feature maps of different layers and sums the outputs of each layer of the decoding path for boundary refinement. Finally, the training model is optimized through a hybrid loss function. The proposed model is experimentally evaluated on the lung segmentation dataset of the Kaggle competition. The accuracy, Dice similarity coefficient, intersection ratio, and Hausdorff distance of the network segmentation are improved by 98.79\%, 97.35\%, 96.34\%, and 12.82 mm, respectively, from those of other segmentation methods. According to these results, the method can more precisely segment pulmonary parenchyma than the existing methods.

With the rapid development of big data and artificial intelligence technology, especially the emergence of Transformer learning models, new methods have been brought to image feature extraction and classification. However, the existing transformer model limits the ability to handle variable-length sequences and understand complex sequence relationships. In this work, we propose a novel transformer-based framework that combines a self-attention mechanism and a multi-head attention technique to efficiently extract features from complex image data. In addition, we introduce an improved classifier that enables efficient image classification using extracted features. Our method takes into account not only the local features of the image but also the global relationships between different regions to achieve a more accurate representation of the features. We simulate our model with existing convolutional neural networks and other traditional machine learning methods in the public datasets including CIFAR-10 and MNIST. From our experimental results, we can observe that our transformer-learning-based framework shows significant performance improvement in image feature extraction and classifica-tion tasks.

    abstract = {Device-to-Device (D2D) communication emerges as a pivotal technology for enhancing the capacity and coverage of networks. Nonetheless, these networks are vulnerable to threats posed by malicious devices (MDs) that have the potential to tamper with transmitted content, thereby com-promising the network's reliability. The trust model is one of the effective methods to solve such internal attacks. Previous research mainly evaluated device trust based on social similarity and passive trust models. These methods make it difficult to obtain accurate evaluation results. Even though there are some active trust models, they have limitations such as high cost and limited scope of application. To solve the above problems, we propose a low-cost collaborative active detection trust evaluation method. In this method, the device first generates some smaller detection packets, verification codes and sends them directly to the trusted alliance party. Then, during each trust eval-uation process, the device determines the trust of nodes on the multi-hop path by actively sending these detection packets to the trusted alliance party. Experimental results show that, compared with existing strategies, our proposed strategy can achieve higher trust evaluation accuracy with lower energy consumption.

However, existing truth dis-covery methods for Crowd Sensing systems face challenges in effectively evaluating the quality of uploaded image data by workers and defending against attacks by malicious workers. To overcome these issues, we introduce a truth discovery method with the trust-aware self-supervised discrim-inative (SSD) model for visual crowdsensing, namely TASSD. In the TASSD, we incorporate the worker's trustworthiness in the reweighting mechanism of the SSD model, thereby improving system robustness and reliability. Then, we designed a trust update method to accurately obtain the worker's trustworthiness. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed TASSD over traditional anomaly detection methods, particularly in scenarios with high ratios of abnormal data. TASSD effectively addresses disguised malicious worker attacks that achieve high credibility.

Knowledge graph is one of the mainstream forms of knowledge base organization, which can clearly express the complex relationships between different objects. Therefore, introducing knowledge graph into driving behavior management is of great significance to improve decision making ability. This study analyzes the characteristics of driving behavior affected by weather, and constructs the knowledge expression model of ``weather condition–environmental condition–driving behavior''. On this basis, a representation method based on characteristic value is proposed, and then the driving behavior knowledge graph is constructed. This method can clearly express the comprehensive relationship between weather condition and driving behavior, and provide support for vehicle driving behavior decision under complex weather condition. We take the existing relevant standards in the field of Meteorology and road traffic laws and regulations as examples to verify the practicability of the method. It lays a foundation for the construction of the knowledge graph of weather factors affecting driving behavior for autonomous vehicles in the future.

Firstly, in order to enhance the detection performance of small and low-contrast defects, the method constructs an offline color model based on GMM theory and builds a saliency numerical channel that integrates the saliency of anomalous targets on RGB data. Secondly, the SE mechanism of the network is optimized, integrating the CBAM (convolution block attention module) structure to enhance the perception of structural features in anomalous regions through strengthened spatial attention mechanisms. Furthermore, the abnormal loss function is adjusted by employing a Gaussian model to establish a label assignment loss function strategy, simplifying parameter tuning and improving the model's motivation for small proportion defects. This enhancement aims to improve the detection performance of the model under conditions of imbalanced samples. Experiments indicate that the algorithm, implemented on a self-built application platform using real-world datasets, achieved a 5.6\% increase in accuracy and a 5.8\% increase in recall at the cost of only 0.5\% time delay. The algorithm meets the requirements of timeliness and reliability for detecting defects online, contributing to the enhancement of efficiency in apple quality grading and production.

Furthermore, leveraging Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units (BiGRU) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) at the sentence level enables the capture of both sequential and structural features. At the entity-adjacent word level, a fusion of two fully connected neural networks extracts intricate associations between entities and neighboring words. Rigorous ablation and comparative experiments conducted on a comprehensive corpus underscore the efficacy of our proposed approach. Remarkably, compared to benchmark methods, our model exhibits a substantial 6.61\% increase in recall rate and a note-worthy 5.31\% improvement in the F1 value.

We propose an Adaptive Meta-Feature Weighting (AMFW-YOLO) object detection model for solving these problems. This model introduces an attention mechanism based on spatial and channel-wise squeeze-and-excitation (scSE) blocks, which helps the model focus on the regions of interest in the target samples and suppresses interference from background regions. Additionally, to compensate for the feature shift caused during the fine-tuning stage, we design an Adaptive Meta-Feature Weighting module (AMFW), This module embeds positional information into spatial features, captures long-range dependencies along two directions, and adaptively compensates for the weights of deep global features, effectively improving the accuracy of the model.

    abstract = {Chinese Named Entity Recognition methods primarily consist of span-based approaches and sequence-to-sequence methods. However, the former focuses solely on the recognition of entity boundaries, while the latter is susceptible to exposure bias. To address these issues, a Chinese NER method based on dictionary enhancement and self-attention fusion convolution is proposed. Initially, the text is encoded using the pre-trained model ERNIE 3.0 and lexical representations. Then, Bi-LSTM is utilized to further capture the contextual information of the sequence, resulting in the final character representations. Subsequently, a two-dimensional (2D) grid is constructed for modeling character pairs, and a feature integration layer is developed by merging self-attention mechanisms and convolution to refine and capture the interactions between characters. Finally, a joint predictor composed of a dual-affine classifier and multilayer perceptrons is used to predict entity categories. Experimental results demonstrate that this method can effectively recognize both flat and nested named entities. Compared to the current best-performing baseline models, the proposed method achieves an increase of 0.14\% and 2.53\% in F1 scores on the flat datasets Resume and Weibo, respectively, and an improvement of 0.52\% in F1 score on the nested dataset ACE2005.

Traditional cardinality estimation approaches often fail to provide precise estimates, leading to suboptimal query plans.

For tree-based learning methods, a conventional way to simply encode nearby parent-child pairs and learn by iteratively training hampers the performance. But it leads to a signiﬁcant loss of structural information and incurs substantial computational overhead by the iterative training process. In this paper, we proposed a tree-structure positional encoding scheme. It can not only extract effective features for each node, but also capture the inherent structural characteristics of the tree.

An attention-based and lightweight YOLOv5 forestry pest identiﬁcation method was proposed. First of all, the traditional backbone network CSPDarknet is modiﬁed to the improved ShufﬂeNetV2, which simpliﬁes the network structure and makes the network more lightweight; Secondly, the hybrid attention mechanism CBAM (Convolutional Block Attention Module) is introduced to increase the perception ability of cyberspace and channel features while keeping the parameters and calculation load basically unchanged. Finally, the loss function is replaced by WIoU to improve model training to speed up model convergence and improve regression accuracy. The average detection accuracy of the improved model is 89.9\%, which is 3.6\% higher than that of the original YOLOv5s algorithm; The parameters decreased by 3213050 and the calculation amount decreased by 7.8.

    abstract = {Deep learning network models have achieved inspiring performances in various ﬁelds such as computer vision, natural language processing, and biomedicine. However, the high computational and storage costs of the models restrain their application in resource-limited situations. However, due to the increased com-plexity and computation of deep neural networks, there are still some challenges in deploying deep learning models into real-world applications for resource-constrained devices. To address this problem, researchers have proposed various quantization algorithms to decrease the expenditure of calculation and storage in deep learning models. This thesis addresses the problem of hierarchical quantization of deep learning models and proposes a simple hierarchical quantization algorithm that aims to effectively reduce the computation and storage requirements of deep learning network models and maintain the accuracy of the models. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed hierarchical quantization method, we conducted experiments on several classical deep learning models. Our experiments prove our approach can better maintain the models' accuracy while reduc-ing the storage and computation requirements compared to the traditional quantization algorithms.}

Nonetheless, akin to its classical counterpart, this emerging ﬁeld is not exempt from security vulnerabilities. Quantum machine learning systems, regardless of whether they process classical or quantum inputs, are susceptible to minor perturbations that can erroneously skew classiﬁcation outcomes. These minute disruptions, often imperceptible to human observation, present a signiﬁcant challenge in ensuring the integrity of quantum classiﬁers. As the complexity of quantum classiﬁers increases, their vulnerability also gradually grows. To mitigate this issue, this paper proposes a novel hybrid classical-quantum neural network model that enhances the model's adversarial robustness by adding a preprocessing layer for noise reduction and data reconstruction. Experiments demonstrate that this model exhibits higher efﬁciency and accuracy in noisy environments and against adversarial attacks.}

QSD can dynamically adjust the ship domain model according to different speeds to address different encounter situations. The combination of RVO and QSD combines the dynamic ship domain with the obstacle avoidance algorithm, which makes the water transport safer than the traditional obstacle avoidance algorithm. In addition, this paper also compares the effects of VO (Velocity obstacle) and RVO, and the results indicate that RVO has smoother obstacle avoidance.}

By establishing a federated group mechanism based on model relevance, each client has its own federated group, and model parameters are only transmitted among fed- erated group members, members outside the group are unable to access parameter information. Secret owners utilize secret sharing algorithms to split their model parameters into several secret shares, which are then transmitted to federated group members through secure channels. Federated group members then aggregate all transmitted secret shares by weighted averaging, and the secret owner receives the aggregated secret shares passed back from all federated group members, and then uses the secret recovery algorithms to recover secret, and obtains the updated parameter model. In the federated group, while a member becomes a Byzantine node, it is removed from the federated group, and another client is selected to join the group based on model relevance. So, each client participating in federated learning serves as both a data node and a computing node, federated learning eliminates reliance on servers and achieves decentralization. The good privacy performance of the proposed algorithm model is theoretically analyzed, and experiments on the FedML platform demonstrated that the algorithm has stronger resistance to attacks.}

Clusters of Multi-UAV can accomplish more complex tasks, optimizing overall efﬁciency through rational task allocation. In practical scenarios, they exhibit distinct advantages and characteristics. However, the allocation of tasks to Multi-UAV in special environments or emergency conditions poses a widely studied problem. Existing research or methods often impose ﬁxed task priorities (task sequences) during Multi-UAV task allocation. Yet, real-world UAV operations may witness ﬂuctuations in task priorities due to environmental changes or human factors. For instance, areas experiencing a drop in temperature may heighten the urgency of certain supplies, or sudden outbreaks of disease may increase the demand for medical supplies. In such cases, conventional planning methods become inadequate. Hence, this paper addresses these scenarios by proposing a model for dynamic task priority changes in Multi-UAV task allocation within special environments. This thesis introduces an improved genetic algorithm, termed the improved partheno geneticgreedy combination algorithm. Through comparative experiments, the efﬁcacy of the proposed algorithm in addressing dynamic priority changes in Multi-UAV collaborative task allocation problems is validated, enhancing problem-solving efﬁciency.}

We implemented these features to build 3 supervised models and compare their predictive performances, namely K-Nearest Neighbours, XGBoost and Logistic Regression. We adopted a train test split measure of 300 training sets and 100 testing sets. Using performance metrics such as confusion matrices, ROC curves, F1, Precision, Recall, and Accuracy scores, we constructed a scoring table to rank implemented models. Our results demonstrated that XGBoost exhibited the most signiﬁcant predictive performance, followed by KNN and Logistic Regression. 5-Fold cross-validation feature stability and sensitivity analysis suggests that the feature space cre- ated is robust and stable where features are not easily subject to change in short-term predictions.}
