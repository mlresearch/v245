title: Collaborative Learning with Curriculum Loss for Accurate and Interpretable Weakly
  Supervised Whole-Slide Image Classification
abstract: 'Weakly-Supervised Learning (WSL) has been increasingly concerned in Whole-Slide
  Image (WSI) classification, meanwhile, an open question arises: could WSL-based
  models provide us with an accurate interpretation of their decisions? Although many
  research works have made exciting progress via building an Auxiliary Instance Branch
  (AIB) on a bag-level network, there are still two typical problems to be confronted
  with in training WSL-based AIB: i) an overwhelming influence of negative instances
  and ii) the inconsistent learning between bag-level network and AIB. To address
  them, this paper proposes collaborative learning with curriculum loss. This scheme,
  on one hand, provides a curriculum loss for optimizing AIB, to alleviate the first
  problem. Considering the knowledge reliability in WSL, this loss generalizes an
  original quality focal loss to WSL scenarios by curriculum instances. On the other
  hand, to overcome the second problem, this scheme trains a bag-level network under
  the supervision of AIB by a reversed curriculum loss, making both learn collaboratively.
  Comparative experiments prove that our scheme could often surpass existing ones
  in both accuracy and interpretability. Moreover, it is found that the knowledge
  reliability-inspired curriculum instance is a critical factor in bringing comprehensive
  improvements.'
